  ABSTRACT =
{This thesis presents a parallel resolution method for sparse linear systems which combines effectively techniques of direct and iterative solvers using a Schur complement approach. A domain decomposition is built ; the interiors of the subdomains are eliminated by a direct method in order to use an iterative method only on the interface unknowns. The system on the interface (Schur complement) is solved thanks to an iterative method preconditioned by a global incomplete factorization. A special ordering on the Schur complement allows to build a scalable preconditioner. Algorithms minimizing the memory peak that appears during the construction of the preconditioner are presented. The memory is balanced thanks to a multiple domains per processors parallelization scheme. The methods are implemented in the Hips solver and parallel experimental results are presented on large industrial test cases.}
