{This thesis deals with the high performance computation problems and more specifically with those of scientific parallel computation for irregular real-world applications.

In the first part, we describe a method for overlapping communications on parallel computers with distributed memory. This method has resulted in  a generic computation scheme for the optimal packet size. We also tackle the problem of finding the optimal computation grain for the Cholesky factorization algorithm for dense matrices. The goal of this study is to exploit the irregularity induced by the matrix symmetry. Based on this work we have developped a portable software library providing an efficient application context for these techniques.

The second part of this thesis presents and analyses a general algorithm for the computation of an efficient static scheduling of block computations, developped especially for a parallel direct sparse linear factorization based on a combination of 1D and 2D block distributions. Our solver uses a supernodal Fan-In approach and is fully driven by our static scheduling algorithm. Compared to the existing parallel direct solvers our solver shows very favorable performance results.}

{New supercomputers incorporate many microprocessors which include themselves one or many computational cores. These new architectures induce strongly hierarchical topologies.

They need to be adapted to these new architectures with Non Uniform Memory Accesses. We propose to introduce a dynamic scheduling designed for NUMA architectures in the PaStiX, solver. The data structures of the solver, as well as the patterns of communication have been modified to meet the needs of these architectures and dynamic scheduling. We are also interested in the dynamic adaptation of the computation grain to use efficiently multi-core architectures and shared memory. Experiments on several numerical test cases will be presented to prove the efficiency of the approach on different architectures.}

  ABSTRACT =
  {
The ongoing hardware evolution exhibits an escalation in the number, as well as in the heterogeneity, of computing resources. The pressure to maintain reasonable levels of performance and portability forces application developers to leave the traditional programming paradigms and explore alternative solutions. PaStiX is a parallel sparse direct solver, based on a dynamic scheduler for modern hierarchical manycore architectures. In this thesis, we study the benefits and the limits of replacing the highly specialized internal scheduler of the PaStiX solver by two generic runtime systems: PaRSEC and StarPU. Thus, we have to describe the factorization algorithm as a tasks graph that we provide to the runtime system. Then it can decide how to process and optimize the graph traversal in order to maximize the algorithm efficiency for the targeted hardware platform. A comparative study of the performance of the PaStiX solver on top of its original internal scheduler, PaRSEC, and StarPU frameworks is performed. The analysis highlights that these generic task-based runtimes achieve comparable results to the application-optimized embedded scheduler on homogeneous platforms. Furthermore, they are able to significantly speed up the solver on heterogeneous environments by taking advantage of the accelerators while hiding the complexity of their efficient manipulation from the programmer. In this thesis, we also study the possibilities to build a distributed sparse linear solver on top of task-based runtime systems to target heterogeneous clusters. To permit an efficient and easy usage of these developments in parallel simulations, we also present an optimized distributed interface aiming at hiding the complexity of the construction of a distributed matrix to the user.

  {
In this thesis, we focus on the parallel solving of large sparse linear systems.
Our main interest is on direct-iterative hybrid solvers such as HIPS, MAPHYS, PDSLIN or SHYLU,
which rely on domain decomposition and Schur complement approaches.
Althrough these solvers are not as time and space consuming as direct methods, they still
suffer from serious overheads.
In a first part, we thus present the existing techniques for reducing the memory consumption,
and we present
a new method which does not impact the numerical robustness of the preconditioner. This technique
reduces the memory peak by doing a special scheduling of computation, allocation, and freeing tasks
in particular in the Schur coupling blocks of the matrix.
In a second part, we focus on the load balancing of the domain decomposition in a parallel context.
This problem consists in partitioning the adjacency graph of the matrix in as many domains as desired.
We point out that a good load balancing
for the most expensive steps of an hybrid solver such as MAPHYS
relies on the balancing of both
interior nodes and interface nodes of the domains. Through, until now, graph partitioners such as
METIS or SCOTCH used to optimize only the first criteria (i.e. the balancing of interior nodes)
in the context of sparse matrix ordering.
We propose different variations of the existing algorithms to improve the balancing
of interface nodes and interior nodes simultaneously.
All our changes are implemented in the SCOTCH partitioner. We present our results on large collection of matrices coming from real industrial cases.

ABSTRACT =
  {
  Solving sparse linear systems is a problem that arises in many
  scientific applications, and sparse direct solvers are a time
  consuming and key kernel for those applications and for more
  advanced solvers such as hybrid direct-iterative solvers. For those
  reasons, optimizing their performance on modern architectures is
  critical. However, memory requirements and time-to-solution limit
  the use of direct methods for very large matrices. For other
  approaches, such as iterative methods, general black-box
  preconditioners that can ensure fast convergence for a wide range of
  problems are still missing. In the first part of this thesis, we
  present two approaches using a Block Low-Rank (BLR) compression
  technique to reduce the memory footprint and/or the time-to-solution
  of a supernodal sparse direct solver. This flat, non-hierarchical,
  compression method allows to take advantage of the low-rank property
  of the blocks appearing during the factorization of sparse linear
  systems. The proposed solver can be used either as a direct solver
  at a lower precision or as a very robust preconditioner. The first
  approach, called Minimal-Memory, illustrates the maximum memory gain that
  can be obtained with the BLR compression method, while the second
  approach, called Just-In-Time, mainly focuses on reducing the
  computational complexity and thus the time-to-solution. In the
  second part, we present a reordering strategy that increases the
  block granularity to better take advantage of the locality for
  multicores and provide larger tasks to GPUs. This strategy relies on
  the block-symbolic factorization to refine the ordering produced by
  tools such as Metis or Scotch, but it does not impact the number
  of operations required to solve the problem. From this approach, we
  propose in the third part of this manuscript a new low-rank
  clustering technique that is designed to cluster unknowns within a
  separator to obtain the BLR partition, and demonstrate its assets
  with respect to widely used clustering strategies. Both reordering
  and clustering where designed for the flat BLR representation but
  are also a first step to move to hierarchical formats.  We
  investigate in the last part of this thesis a modified nested
  dissection strategy that aligns separators with respect to their
  father to obtain more regular data structure.

  {In this talk, we present the PaStiX sparse supernodal solver, using hierarchical compression to reduce the burden on large blocks appearing during the nested dissection process. We compare the numerical stability, and the performance in terms of memory consumption and time to solution of different approaches by selecting when the compression of the factorized matrix occurs. In order to improve the efficiency of the sparse update kernel for both BLR (block low rank) and HODLR (hierarchically off-diagonal low-rank), we investigate the BDLR (boundary distance low-rank) method to preselect rows and columns in the low-rank approximation algorithm.}

  ABSTRACT =
  {Sparse direct solvers is a time consuming operation required by many
scientific applications to simulate physical problems. By its important overall
cost, many studies tried to optimize the time to solution of those solvers
on multi-core and distributed architectures. More recently, many works
have addressed heterogeneous architectures to exploit accelerators such as
GPUs or Intel Xeon Phi with interesting speedup. Despite researches towards
generic solutions to efficiently exploit those accelerators, their hardware
evolution requires continual adaptation of the kernels running on those
architectures. The recent Nvidia architectures, as Kepler, present a larger
number of parallel units thus requiring more data to feed every computational
units. A solution considered to supply enough computation has been
to study problems with large number of small computations. The batched
BLAS libraries proposed by Intel, Nvidia, or the University of Tennessee are
examples of this solution. We discuss in this talk the use of the variable size
batched matrix-matrix multiply to improve the performance of a the PaStiX
sparse direct solver. Indeed, this kernel suits the supernodal method of the
solver, and the multiple updates of variable sizes that occur during the numerical
factorization. Performance results on a spectrum of matrices with
different properties will be presented.}

  ABSTRACT = {
In this paper, we consider a hyperbolic system with multiple time step characteristics. Such a situation arises for example in combustion problems when the acoustic time is small compared to the characteristic time associated to the flame propagation. The problems investigated in this paper are characterized by a small Mach number.
At the asymptotic limit, the initial hyperbolic system degenerates to an elliptic problem. Therefore, numerical methods proposed with the assumption of hyperbolicity of the system becomes hill conditioned at this limit. As a consequence, the iterative methods used in the numerical algorithm implemented in the software FluidBox, have a worse convergence behavior.
Some physical preconditioning has been proposed to overcome this difficulty. However, in the context of parallel computing, a global preconditioning is unavoidable for performance efficiency.

The parallelization of FluidBox relies on a domain decomposition.
A first version of FluidBox was using a block Jacobi or a block Gauss-Seidel preconditioner that are easily implementable in this framework.
But to solve  3D problems up to several millions of unknowns on numerous processors, this kind of preconditioner becomes inefficient du to their lack of scalability and robustness.
Hence, a collaboration inside the INRIA ScAlApplix project has been setup to use the high performance solver library PaStiX that provides both complete and incomplete factorizations on clusters of SMP nodes to solve large scale
computations.

The aim of this work is then to investigate the performance of the combination of FluidBox and PaStiX (both developped in the INRIA ScAlApplix project) and also present the parallel assembly algorithm that allows a good load balance in this context.

  ABSTRACT =
{In recent years there has been a resurgence in direct methods to solve linear systems. These methods can have many advantages compared to iterative solvers; in particular their accuracy and performance is less sensitive to the distribution of eigenvalues. However, they typically have a larger computational cost in cases where iterative solvers converge in few iterations. We will discuss a recent trend of methods that address this cost and can make these direct solvers competitive. Techniques involved include hierarchical matrices, hierarchically semi-separable matrices, fast multipole method, etc.}

  ABSTRACT =
{
Sparse direct solvers is a time consuming operation required by many
scientific applications to simulate physical problems. By its important overall
cost, many studies tried to optimize the time to solution of those solvers
on multi-core and distributed architectures. More recently, many works
have addressed heterogeneous architectures to exploit accelerators such as
GPUs or Intel Xeon Phi with interesting speedup. Despite researches towards
generic solutions to efficiently exploit those accelerators, their hardware
evolution requires continual adaptation of the kernels running on those
architectures. The recent Nvidia architectures, as Kepler, present a larger
number of parallel units thus requiring more data to feed every computational
units. A solution considered to supply enough computation has been
to study problems with large number of small computations. The batched
BLAS libraries proposed by Intel, Nvidia, or the University of Tennessee are
examples of this solution. We discuss in this talk the use of the variable size
batched matrix-matrix multiply to improve the performance of a the PaStiX
sparse direct solver. Indeed, this kernel suits the supernodal method of the
solver, and the multiple updates of variable sizes that occur during the numerical
factorization. Performance results on a spectrum of matrices with
different properties will be presented.}

  ABSTRACT = {
Sparse direct solvers is a time consuming operation required by many scientific applications to simulate physical problems. By its important overall cost, many studies tried to optimize the time to solution of those solvers on multi-core and distributed architectures.  In this talk, we will present recent advances on PaStiX (https://gitlab.inria.fr/solverstack/pastix), a supernodal sparse direct solver, which has been enhanced by the introduction of Block Low-Rank compression.  We will compare the numerical stability, and the performance in terms of memory consumption and time to solution of different approaches by selecting when the compression of the factorized matrix occurs.
Many works have also addressed heterogeneous architectures to exploit accelerators such as GPUs or Intel Xeon Phi with interesting speedup. The new implementation on top of runtime systems (PaRSEC, StarPU), will be compared with the static scheduling used in previous experiments. Among the preprocessing steps of a sparse direct solver, reordering and block symbolic factorization are two major steps to reach a suitable granularity. In this talk, we will present a reordering strategy to increase off-diagonal block sizes. It enhances BLAS kernels and allows to handle larger tasks, reducing runtime overhead.
Finally, in order to improve the efficiency of the sparse update kernel for both BLR (block low rank) and HODLR (hierarchically off-diagonal low-rank), we are currently investigating the BDLR (boundary distance low-rank) method to preselect rows and columns in the low-rank approximation algorithm.

  ABSTRACT =
{
In the context of hybrid sparse linear solvers based on domain decomposition
and Schur complement approaches, getting a domain decomposition tool leading
to a good balancing of both the internal node set size and the interface node set size
for all the domains is a critical point for load balancing and efficiency issues in a
parallel computation context. For this purpose, we revisit the original algorithm introduced by Lipton, Rose and
Tarjan which performed the recursion for nested dissection in
a particular manner. From this specific recursive strategy, we propose in this paper several variations of
the existing algorithms in the multilevel Scotch partitioner that take into account
these multiple criteria and we illustrate the improved results on a collection of
graphs corresponding to finite element meshes used in numerical scientific applications.

  ABSTRACT =
{
L'\'emergence des machines parall\`eles t\'eraflopiques permet maintenant de traiter des probl\`emes de diffraction de tr\`es grande taille li\'es \`a des calculs hautes fr\'equences par des m\'ethodes exactes.
Une premi\`ere \'etape de ce travail a constist\'e \`a parall\'eliser des codes s\'equentiels existants qui utilisaient des m\'ethodes num\'eriques classiques.
Ces codes \'etaient bas\'es sur un couplage fort par compl\'ement de Schur entre une formulation int\'egrale (\'el\'ements-finis surfaciques pour traiter la condition de radiation \`a l'infini) et une formulation \'el\'ements-finis volumiques (pour calculer les champs \`a l'int\'erieur de l'objet).
L'adapation au parall\'elisme a consist\'e \`a parall\'eliser la factorisation du syst\`eme lin\'eaire creux (\`a l'aide de la biblioth\'eque EMILIO/PaStiX, la r\'esolution du syst\`eme int\'egral plein (sym\'etrique, complexe) et le couplage par compl\'ement de Schur (consistant en des descentes-remont\'ees sur le syst\`eme creux associ\'e).
Les deux premi\`eres \'etapes cit\'ees ont donn\'e pleinement satisfaction, mais le compl\'ement de Schur, \`a cause du tr\'es grand nombre descentes-remont\'ees li\'ees aux inconnues surfaciques, limite l'efficacit\'e globale de cette approche \`a des probl\`emes de taille interm\'ediaire.
Par exemple, pour le cas test du ``Sphere-Cone'' comportant $3.10^6$ d'inconnues volumiques et $23.10^3$ inconnues surfaciques, sur 32 n\oe uds ES45 (quadri-processeurs), l'assemblage volumique repr\'esente 6s, la factorisation du syst\`eme creux est obtenue en 376s et le compl\'ement de Schur en 21500s (en complexe double pr\'ecision).
Pour d\'epasser ces limites, une \'evolution globale de l'algorithme a \'et\'e n\'ecessaire~:
- un couplage it\'eratif entre les r\'esolutions surfacique et volumique a \'et\'e mis en place;
- pour augmenter le nombre d'inconnues surfaciques une m\'ethode multip\^ole multi-niveaux parall\'ele a \'et\'e d\'evelopp\'ee;
- enfin, pour atteindre des tailles de probl\`eme de plusieurs dizaines de millions d'inconnues volumiques, des \'evolutions ont \'et\'e apport\'ees dans la biblioth\`eque EMILIO/PaStiX. En particulier, une algorithmique sp\'ecifique a \'et\'e mise en place pour utiliser au mieux les clusters de n\oe uds SMP et pour pr\'eserver une scalabilit\'e m\'emoire raisonnable.
Enfin, le sch\'ema actuel pr\'esente un couplage direct-it\'eratif \`a plusieurs niveaux. L'\'evolution envisag\'ee sera un couplage it\'eratif-it\'eratif, puis sera bas\'ee sur des m\'ethodes hybrides globales (interm\'ediaire entre le direct et l'it\'eratif)~: une version de PaStiX \'evolu\'ee permettra de calculer un pr\'econdition\-neur par bloc ILU(k) parall\`ele.

  ABSTRACT =
{
Since the last decade, most of the supercomputer architectures are based on cluster of SMP nodes.
In those architectures the exchanges between processors are made through shared memory when the processor are located on a same SMP node and through the network otherwise.
Generally, the MPI implementations provided by the constructor on those machines are adapted to this situation and take advantage of the share memory to treat messages between processors in a same SMP node. Nevertheless, this transparent approach to exploit shared memory do not avoid the storage of buffers needed in asynchronous communications.
In the parallel direct solvers the storage of these buffers can become a bottleneck. In this paper, we propose an hybrid thread-MPI implementation of a direct solver and analyse the benefits of this approach in term of memory and run-time performances.

  ABSTRACT = {The use of scientific computing centers becomes more and more difficult on modern parallel architectures. Users must face a large variety of batch systems (with their own specific syntax) and have to set many parameters to tune their applications (e.g., processors and/or threads mapping, memory resource constraints). Moreover, finding the optimal performance is not the only criteria when a pool of jobs is submitted on the Grid (for numerical parametric analysis for instance) and one must focus on the wall-time completion. In this work we tackle the problem by using the D IET Grid middleware that integrates an adaptable PaStiX service to solve a set of experiments issued from the simulations of the ASTER project.}

  ABSTRACT = {
The current trend in the high performance computing shows a dramatic increase in the number of cores on the shared memory compute nodes. Algorithms, especially those related to linear algebra, need to be adapted to these new computer architectures in order to be efficient. PaStiX is a sparse parallel direct solver, that incorporates a dynamic  scheduler for strongly hierarchical modern architectures.  In this work, we study the replacement of this internal highly integrated scheduling strategy by two generic runtime frameworks: DAGuE and StarPU. Those runtimes will give the opportunity to execute the factorization tasks graph on emerging computers equipped with accelerators. As for previous work done in dense linear algebra, we will present the kernels used for GPU computations inspired by the MAGMA library and the DAG algorithm used with those two runtimes. A comparative study of the performances of the supernodal solver with the three different schedulers is performed on ma
nycore architectures and the improvements obtained with accelerators will be presented with the StarPU runtime. These results demonstrate that these DAG runtimes provide uniform programming interfaces to obtain high performance on different architectures on irregular problems as sparse direct factorizations.}

  ABSTRACT = {Over the past few years, parallel sparse direct solvers made significant progress and are now able to solve efficiently industrial three-dimensional problems with several millions of unknowns. An hybrid MPI-thread implementation of our direct solver PaStiX is already well suited for SMP nodes or new multi-core architectures and drastically reduced the memory overhead and improved scalability. In the context of distributed NUMA architectures, a dynamic scheduler based on a work-stealing algorithm has been developed to fill in communication idle times.  On these architectures, it is important to take care of NUMA effects and to preserve memory affinity during the work-stealing. The scheduling of communications also needs to be adapted, especially to ensure the overlap by computations. Experiments on numerical test cases will be presented to prove the efficiency of the approach on NUMA architectures. If memory is not large enough to treat a given problem, disks must be used to store data that cannot fit in memory (out-of-core storage). The idle-times due to disk access have to be managed by our dynamic scheduler to prefetch and save datasets. Thus, we design and study specific scheduling algorithms in this particular context.}

of developers of scientific libraries to adopt new parallel programming paradigms. Among them,
task-based programming has certainly become one of the most popular as it allows for high

to a runtime system. In this talk, we will present an overview of sparse solvers that have been

solvers ensuring pipelining both at a numerical and software level, new sparse hybrid methods
(MaPHyS) as well as data sparse libraries implementing fast multipole methods (ScalFMM)
and hierarchical matrices (hmat, in collaboration with Airbus Group Innovations). For all these
methods, we will highlight the challenges we have faced in terms of expressivity, granularity,

In particular we will describe the current activities on the implementations designed on top of runtime systems that should provide both code and performance portabilities across different parallel platforms. Finally, we will present some preliminary results to address the resilience issues on extreme scale computers; for that purpose we consider numerical alternatives that do not intensively rely on checkpoint restart mechanisms.

  ABSTRACT = {
In the context of solving sparse linear systems, an ordering process partitions the matrix graph to minimize both fill-in and computational cost. We found that the ordering strategy used within supernodes might be enhanced to reduce the number of off-diagonal blocks, and then increases block sizes and kernel performance. This turns to be into the same complexity as the factorization algorithm, but allows for more efficient BLAS kernels. On the other side, supernodes that are too large need to be split to create more parallelism. The regular splitting strategy when applied locally impacts significantly the number of off-diagonal blocks and might have negative effect on the efficiency. In this talk, we present both a new strategy to improve supernodes ordering and splitting strategy that both enlarge the off-diagonal block sizes without changing the computational cost of the factorization. Performance improvement gains on the supernodal solver PaStiX are shown on multi-cores and heterogeneous architectures.

  ABSTRACT =
{The ongoing hardware evolution exhibits an es- calation in the number, as well as in the heterogeneity, of computing resources. The pressure to maintain reasonable levels of performance and portability forces application de- velopers to leave the traditional programming paradigms and explore alternative solutions. PASTIX is a parallel sparse direct solver, based on a dynamic scheduler for modern hierarchical manycore architectures. In this paper, we study the benefits and limits of replacing the highly specialized internal scheduler of the PASTIX solver with two generic runtime systems: PARSEC and STARPU. The tasks graph of the factorization step is made available to the two runtimes, providing them the opportunity to process and optimize its traversal in order to maximize the algorithm efficiency for the targeted hardware platform. A comparative study of the performance of the PASTIX solver on top of its native internal scheduler, PARSEC, and STARPU frameworks, on different execution environments, is performed. The analysis highlights that these generic task-based runtimes achieve comparable results to the application-optimized embed- ded scheduler on homogeneous platforms. Furthermore, they are able to significantly speed up the solver on heterogeneous environments by taking advantage of the accelerators while hiding the complexity of their efficient manipulation from the programmer.}

  ABSTRACT =
{
When solving large sparse linear systems, both the amount of memory needed and the computational cost represent a burden to efficiency. In order to solve larger systems, low-rank strategies are used to reduce the overall complexity of a solver. In this talk, we present a preliminary study of the use of H-Matrix arithmetic in a supernodal solver. We also present a new feature in PaStiX, a reordering strategy to reduce the number of off-diagonal blocks in the symbolic factorization. It allows BLAS kernels to be more efficient, and those ideas could be explored in the context of a low-rank strategy.

  ABSTRACT =
{
In the context of solving sparse linear systems, an ordering process partitions the matrix graph to minimize both fill-in and computational cost. We found that the ordering strategy used within supernodes might be enhanced to reduce the number of off-diagonal blocks, and then increases block sizes and kernel performance. This turns to be into the same complexity as the factorization algorithm, but allows for more efficient BLAS kernels. On the other side, supernodes that are too large need to be split to create more parallelism. The regular splitting strategy when applied locally impacts significantly the number of off-diagonal blocks and might have negative effect on the efficiency. In this talk, we present both a new strategy to improve supernodes ordering and splitting strategy that both enlarge the off-diagonal block sizes without changing the computational cost of the factorization. Performance improvement gains on the supernodal solver PaStiX are shown on multi-cores and heterogeneous architectures.

  ABSTRACT = {
  In this talk, we adress the Block Low-Rank (BLR) clustering problem, to cluster unknowns within separators appearing during the factorization of sparse matrices. We show that methods considering only intra-separators connectivity (i.e., k-way or recursive bissection) as well as methods managing only interaction between separators have some limitations. The new strategy we propose consider interactions between a separator and its children to pre-select some interactions while reducing the number of off-diagonal blocks. We demonstrate how this method enhance the BLR strategies in the sparse direct supernodal solver PaStiX, and discuss how it can be extended to low-rank formats with more than one level of hierarchy.

  ABSTRACT = {
  Task-based programming models have been widely studied in the context of dense linear algebra, but remains less studied for the more complex sparse solvers. In this talk, we will present the use of two different programming models: Sequential Task Flow from StarPU, and Parameterized Task Graph from PaRSEC to parallelize the factorization step of the PaStiX sparse direct solver. We will present how those programming models have been used to integrate more complex and finer parallelism to take into account new architectures with many computational units. Efficiency of such solutions on homogeneous and heterogeneous architectures with a spectrum of matrices from different applications will be shown. We will also present how such solutions enable, without extra cost to the programmer, better performance on irregular computations such as in the block low-rank implementation of the solver.

  ABSTRACT = {
In this talk, we present new ordering heuristics to perform block low-rank clustering in supernodes issued from the nested dissection. As kway partitioning within supernodes does not take into account interactions between supernodes, there is room to improve compression rates. We combine kway partitioning with a reordering strategy that aims at minimizing the number of off-diagonal blocks in the symbolic structure and show that both methods are limited. In addition, we propose a selection of some non-compressible vertices to handle the corresponding blocks in full-rank and reduce the burden on managing low-rank blocks with high ranks.
