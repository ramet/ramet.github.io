   ABSTRACT     = { Solving sparse linear systems is a problem that arises 
      in many scientific applications, and sparse direct solvers are a time 
      consuming and key kernel for those applications and for more advanced 
      solvers such as hybrid direct-iterative solvers. For those reasons, 
      optimizing their performance on modern architectures is critical. 
      However, memory requirements and time-to-solution limit the use of 
      direct methods for very large matrices. For other approaches, such as 
      iterative methods, general black-box preconditioners that can ensure 
      fast convergence for a wide range of problems are still missing. In 
      the first part of this thesis, we present two approaches using a 
      Block Low-Rank (BLR) compression technique to reduce the memory 
      footprint and/or the time-to-solution of a supernodal sparse direct 
      solver. This flat, non-hierarchical, compression method allows to 
      take advantage of the low-rank property of the blocks appearing 
      during the factorization of sparse linear systems. The proposed 
      solver can be used either as a direct solver at a lower precision or 
      as a very robust preconditioner. The first approach, called 
      Minimal-Memory, illustrates the maximum memory gain that can be 
      obtained with the BLR compression method, while the second approach, 
      called Just-In-Time, mainly focuses on reducing the computational 
      complexity and thus the time-to-solution. In the second part, we 
      present a reordering strategy that increases the block granularity to 
      better take advantage of the locality for multicores and provide 
      larger tasks to GPUs. This strategy relies on the block-symbolic 
      factorization to refine the ordering produced by tools such as Metis 
      or Scotch, but it does not impact the number of operations required 
      to solve the problem. From this approach, we propose in the third 
      part of this manuscript a new low-rank clustering technique that is 
      designed to cluster unknowns within a separator to obtain the BLR 
      partition, and demonstrate its assets with respect to widely used 
      clustering strategies. Both reordering and clustering where designed 
      for the flat BLR representation but are also a first step to move to 
      hierarchical formats. We investigate in the last part of this thesis 
      a modified nested dissection strategy that aligns separators with 
      respect to their father to obtain more regular data structure. },

   OPTTYPE      = {},
   YEAR         = {2015},
   ABSTRACT     = { In this thesis, we focus on the parallel solving of 
      large sparse linear systems. Our main interest is on direct-iterative 
      hybrid solvers such as HIPS, MAPHYS, PDSLIN or SHYLU, which rely on 
      domain decomposition and Schur complement approaches. Althrough these 
      solvers are not as time and space consuming as direct methods, they 
      still suffer from serious overheads. In a first part, we thus present 
      the existing techniques for reducing the memory consumption, and we 
      present a new method which does not impact the numerical robustness 
      of the preconditioner. This technique reduces the memory peak by 
      doing a special scheduling of computation, allocation, and freeing 
      tasks in particular in the Schur coupling blocks of the matrix. In a 
      second part, we focus on the load balancing of the domain 
      decomposition in a parallel context. This problem consists in 
      partitioning the adjacency graph of the matrix in as many domains as 
      desired. We point out that a good load balancing for the most 
      expensive steps of an hybrid solver such as MAPHYS relies on the 
      balancing of both interior nodes and interface nodes of the domains. 
      Through, until now, graph partitioners such as METIS or SCOTCH used 
      to optimize only the first criteria (i.e. the balancing of interior 
      nodes) in the context of sparse matrix ordering. We propose different 
      variations of the existing algorithms to improve the balancing of 
      interface nodes and interior nodes simultaneously. All our changes 
      are implemented in the SCOTCH partitioner. We present our results on 
      large collection of matrices coming from real industrial cases. },

   ABSTRACT     = { The ongoing hardware evolution exhibits an escalation 
      in the number, as well as in the heterogeneity, of computing 
      resources. The pressure to maintain reasonable levels of performance 
      and portability forces application developers to leave the 
      traditional programming paradigms and explore alternative solutions. 
      PaStiX is a parallel sparse direct solver, based on a dynamic 
      scheduler for modern hierarchical manycore architectures. In this 
      thesis, we study the benefits and the limits of replacing the highly 
      specialized internal scheduler of the PaStiX solver by two generic 
      runtime systems: PaRSEC and StarPU. Thus, we have to describe the 
      factorization algorithm as a tasks graph that we provide to the 
      runtime system. Then it can decide how to process and optimize the 
      graph traversal in order to maximize the algorithm efficiency for the 
      targeted hardware platform. A comparative study of the performance of 
      the PaStiX solver on top of its original internal scheduler, PaRSEC, 
      and StarPU frameworks is performed. The analysis highlights that 
      these generic task-based runtimes achieve comparable results to the 
      application-optimized embedded scheduler on homogeneous platforms. 
      Furthermore, they are able to significantly speed up the solver on 
      heterogeneous environments by taking advantage of the accelerators 
      while hiding the complexity of their efficient manipulation from the 
      programmer. In this thesis, we also study the possibilities to build 
      a distributed sparse linear solver on top of task-based runtime 
      systems to target heterogeneous clusters. To permit an efficient and 
      easy usage of these developments in parallel simulations, we also 
      present an optimized distributed interface aiming at hiding the 
      complexity of the construction of a distributed matrix to the user. },

   ABSTRACT     = {The reactivity computations are an essential component

      iteration algorithm. At each iteration, an algebraic linear system is 
      solved through an inner/outer process. With the solver Cocagne 
      developed at EDF, it is difficult to take into account very fine 
      discretisation, due to the memory requirement and the computation 
      time. In this thesis, a domain decomposition method based on the 
      Schur dual technique is studied. Several placements in the 
      inner/outer process are possible. Two of them are implemented and the 
      results analyzed. The second one, which uses the specificities of the 
      Raviart Thomas finite elements and of the alternating directions 
      algorithm, leads to very promising results. From these results the 
      industrialization of the method can be considered.},

   ABSTRACT     = {New supercomputers incorporate many microprocessors

      We propose to introduce a dynamic scheduling designed for NUMA 
      architectures in the PaStiX, solver. The data structures of the 
      solver, as well as the patterns of communication have been modified 
      to meet the needs of these architectures and dynamic scheduling. We

   ABSTRACT     = {This thesis presents a parallel resolution method for

      decomposition is built ; the interiors of the subdomains are 
      eliminated by a direct method in order to use an iterative method 
      only on the interface unknowns. The system on the interface (Schur 
      complement) is solved thanks to an iterative method preconditioned by 
      a global incomplete factorization. A special ordering on the Schur 
      complement allows to build a scalable preconditioner. Algorithms 
      minimizing the memory peak that appears during the construction of 
      the preconditioner are presented. The memory is balanced thanks to a 
      multiple domains per processors parallelization scheme. The methods

   ABSTRACT     = {This thesis deals with the high performance computation

      computation for irregular real-world applications. In the first part, 
      we describe a method for overlapping communications on parallel 
      computers with distributed memory. This method has resulted in a 
      generic computation scheme for the optimal packet size. We also 
      tackle the problem of finding the optimal computation grain for the 
      Cholesky factorization algorithm for dense matrices. The goal of this 
      study is to exploit the irregularity induced by the matrix symmetry. 
      Based on this work we have developped a portable software library 
      providing an efficient application context for these techniques. The 
      second part of this thesis presents and analyses a general algorithm 
      for the computation of an efficient static scheduling of block 
      computations, developped especially for a parallel direct sparse 
      linear factorization based on a combination of 1D and 2D block 
      distributions. Our solver uses a supernodal Fan-In approach and is 
      fully driven by our static scheduling algorithm. Compared to the

      in the radial profiles and the fine structure observed in the power 
      deposition profiles at the divertor target. The density perturbation 
      predominantly follows the ballooning mode convection cells leading to 
      density filaments. The temperature perturbation, due to the large 
      parallel conduction, follows the magnetic field perturbation. 
      Simulations of pellets injected in the H-mode pedestal show that the 
      high pressure in the high density plasmoid can become large enough to 
      drive ballooning type modes forming a single helical structure 
      located at the pellet (plasmoid) position.},

   ABSTRACT     = {Among existing preconditioners, the level-of-fill ILU 
      has been quite popular as a general-purpose technique. Experimental 
      observations have shown that, when coupled with block techniques, 
      these methods can be quite effective in solving realistic problems 
      arising from various applications. In this work, we consider an 
      extension of this kind of method which is suitable for parallel 
      environments. Our method is developed from the framework of high 
      performance sparse direct solvers. The main idea we propose is to 
      define an adaptive blockwise incomplete factorization that is much 
      more accurate (and numerically more robust) than the scalar 
      incomplete factorizations commonly used to precondition iterative 
      solvers. These requirements lead to a robust class of parallel 
      preconditioners based on generalized versions of block ILU 
      techniques.},

      scheduling of block computations for parallel sparse linear 
      factorization. The associated solver, based on a supernodal fan-in 
      approach, is fully driven by this scheduling. Second we describe a 
      scalable parallel assembly algorithm based on a distribution of 
      elements induced by the previous distribution for the blocks of the 
      sparse matrix. We give an overview of these algorithms and present 
      performance results on an IBM SP2 for a collection of grid and

      the more complex sparse solvers. In this talk, we will present the

      StarPU, and Parameterized Task Graph from PaRSEC to parallelize the 
      factorization step of the PaStiX sparse direct solver. We will 
      present how those programming models have been used to integrate more 
      complex and finer parallelism to take into account new architectures 
      with many computational units. Efficiency of such solutions on 
      homogeneous and heterogeneous architectures with a spectrum of 
      matrices from different applications will be shown. We will also

      the block low-rank implementation of the solver. },

   ABSTRACT     = { In this talk, we adress the Block Low-Rank (BLR) 
      clustering problem, to cluster unknowns within separators appearing 
      during the factorization of sparse matrices. We show that methods 
      considering only intra-separators connectivity (i.e., k-way or 
      recursive bissection) as well as methods managing only interaction 
      between separators have some limitations. The new strategy we propose 
      consider interactions between a separator and its children to 
      pre-select some interactions while reducing the number of 
      off-diagonal blocks. We demonstrate how this method enhance the BLR 
      strategies in the sparse direct supernodal solver PaStiX, and discuss 
      how it can be extended to low-rank formats with more than one level 
      of hierarchy. },

   ABSTRACT     = { In this talk, we present new ordering heuristics to

      take into account interactions between supernodes, there is room to 
      improve compression rates. We combine kway partitioning with a 
      reordering strategy that aims at minimizing the number of 
      off-diagonal blocks in the symbolic structure and show that both 
      methods are limited. In addition, we propose a selection of some 
      non-compressible vertices to handle the corresponding blocks in 
      full-rank and reduce the burden on managing low-rank blocks with high

   ABSTRACT     = {Sparse direct solvers is a time consuming operation 
      required by many scientific applications to simulate physical 
      problems. By its important overall cost, many studies tried to 
      optimize the time to solution of those solvers on multi-core and 
      distributed architectures. More recently, many works have addressed 
      heterogeneous architectures to exploit accelerators such as GPUs or 
      Intel Xeon Phi with interesting speedup. Despite researches towards 
      generic solutions to efficiently exploit those accelerators, their 
      hardware evolution requires continual adaptation of the kernels 
      running on those architectures. The recent Nvidia architectures, as 
      Kepler, present a larger number of parallel units thus requiring more 
      data to feed every computational units. A solution considered to 
      supply enough computation has been to study problems with large 
      number of small computations. The batched BLAS libraries proposed by 
      Intel, Nvidia, or the University of Tennessee are examples of this 
      solution. We discuss in this talk the use of the variable size 
      batched matrix-matrix multiply to improve the performance of a the 
      PaStiX sparse direct solver. Indeed, this kernel suits the supernodal

   ABSTRACT     = {The complexity of the hardware architectures of modern 
      supercomputers led the community of developers of scientific 
      libraries to adopt new parallel programming paradigms. Among them, 
      task-based programming has certainly become one of the most popular 
      as it allows for high productivity while ensuring high performance 
      and portability by delegating tasks management to a runtime system. 
      In this talk, we will present an overview of sparse solvers that have 
      been designed in the context of the Matrices Over Runtime Systems @ 
      Exascale (MORSE) and Solvers for Heterogeneous Architectures (SOLHAR) 
      projects. We will present the design of new direct solvers 
      implementing supernodal (PaStiX) and multifrontal (qr-mumps) methods, 
      new Krylov solvers ensuring pipelining both at a numerical and 
      software level, new sparse hybrid methods (MaPHyS) as well as data 
      sparse libraries implementing fast multipole methods (ScalFMM) and 
      hierarchical matrices (hmat, in collaboration with Airbus Group 
      Innovations). For all these methods, we will highlight the challenges 
      we have faced in terms of expressivity, granularity, scheduling and 
      scalability and illustrate their performance on large academic and 
      industrial test problems.},

   ABSTRACT     = { In the context of solving sparse linear systems, an 
      ordering process partitions the matrix graph to minimize both fill-in 
      and computational cost. We found that the ordering strategy used 
      within supernodes might be enhanced to reduce the number of 
      off-diagonal blocks, and then increases block sizes and kernel 
      performance. This turns to be into the same complexity as the 
      factorization algorithm, but allows for more efficient BLAS kernels. 
      On the other side, supernodes that are too large need to be split to 
      create more parallelism. The regular splitting strategy when applied 
      locally impacts significantly the number of off-diagonal blocks and 
      might have negative effect on the efficiency. In this talk, we 
      present both a new strategy to improve supernodes ordering and 
      splitting strategy that both enlarge the off-diagonal block sizes 
      without changing the computational cost of the factorization. 
      Performance improvement gains on the supernodal solver PaStiX are 
      shown on multi-cores and heterogeneous architectures. },

   ABSTRACT     = { In the context of hybrid sparse linear solvers based on 
      domain decomposition and Schur complement approaches, getting a 
      domain decomposition tool leading to a good balancing of both the 
      internal node set size and the interface node set size for all the 
      domains is a critical point for load balancing and efficiency issues 
      in a parallel computation context. For this purpose, we revisit the 
      original algorithm introduced by Lipton, Rose and Tarjan which 
      performed the recursion for nested dissection in a particular manner. 
      From this specific recursive strategy, we propose in this paper 
      several variations of the existing algorithms in the multilevel 
      Scotch partitioner that take into account these multiple criteria and 
      we illustrate the improved results on a collection of graphs 
      corresponding to finite element meshes used in numerical scientific 
      applications. },

   ABSTRACT     = {In recent years there has been a resurgence in direct 
      methods to solve linear systems. These methods can have many 
      advantages compared to iterative solvers; in particular their 
      accuracy and performance is less sensitive to the distribution of 
      eigenvalues. However, they typically have a larger computational cost 
      in cases where iterative solvers converge in few iterations. We will 
      discuss a recent trend of methods that address this cost and can make

   ABSTRACT     = {The ongoing hardware evolution exhibits an es- calation 
      in the number, as well as in the heterogeneity, of computing 
      resources. The pressure to maintain reasonable levels of performance 
      and portability forces application de- velopers to leave the 
      traditional programming paradigms and explore alternative solutions. 
      PASTIX is a parallel sparse direct solver, based on a dynamic 
      scheduler for modern hierarchical manycore architectures. In this 
      paper, we study the benefits and limits of replacing the highly 
      specialized internal scheduler of the PASTIX solver with two generic 
      runtime systems: PARSEC and STARPU. The tasks graph of the 
      factorization step is made available to the two runtimes, providing 
      them the opportunity to process and optimize its traversal in order 
      to maximize the algorithm efficiency for the targeted hardware 
      platform. A comparative study of the performance of the PASTIX solver 
      on top of its native internal scheduler, PARSEC, and STARPU 
      frameworks, on different execution environments, is performed. The 
      analysis highlights that these generic task-based runtimes achieve 
      comparable results to the application-optimized embed- ded scheduler 
      on homogeneous platforms. Furthermore, they are able to significantly 
      speed up the solver on heterogeneous environments by taking advantage 
      of the accelerators while hiding the complexity of their efficient 
      manipulation from the programmer.},

   ABSTRACT     = { The current trend in the high performance computing 
      shows a dramatic increase in the number of cores on the shared memory 
      compute nodes. Algorithms, especially those related to linear 
      algebra, need to be adapted to these new computer architectures in 
      order to be efficient. PaStiX is a sparse parallel direct solver, 
      that incorporates a dynamic scheduler for strongly hierarchical 
      modern architectures. In this work, we study the replacement of this 
      internal highly integrated scheduling strategy by two generic runtime 
      frameworks: DAGuE and StarPU. Those runtimes will give the 
      opportunity to execute the factorization tasks graph on emerging 
      computers equipped with accelerators. As for previous work done in 
      dense linear algebra, we will present the kernels used for GPU 
      computations inspired by the MAGMA library and the DAG algorithm used 
      with those two runtimes. A comparative study of the performances of 
      the supernodal solver with the three different schedulers is 
      performed on ma nycore architectures and the improvements obtained 
      with accelerators will be presented with the StarPU runtime. These 
      results demonstrate that these DAG runtimes provide uniform 
      programming interfaces to obtain high performance on different 
      architectures on irregular problems as sparse direct factorizations.},

   ABSTRACT     = {The simulation of the neutron transport inside a nuclear 
      reactor leads to the computation of the lowest eigen pair of a 
      simplified transport operator. This computation is done by a power 
      inverse algorithm accelerated by a Chebyshev polynomials based 
      process. At each iteration, a large linear system is solved inexactly 
      by a block Gauss-Seidel algorithm. For our applications, one 
      Gauss-Seidel iteration is already sufficient to ensure the right 
      convergence of the inverse power algorithm. For the approximate 
      resolution of the linear system at each inverse power iteration, we 
      propose a non overlapping domain decomposition based on the 
      introduction of Lagrange multipliers in order to: - get a parallel 
      algorithm, which allows to circumvent memory consumption problem and 
      to reduce the computational time; - deal with different numerical 
      approximations in each subdomain; - minimize the code modifications 
      in our industrial solver. When the Chebyshev acceleration process is 
      switched off, the method performs well on up to 100 processors for an 
      industrial test case. It exhibits a good efficiency which allows us 
      to realize some computations beyond the reach of standard 
      workstations. Besides, we study the efficiency of the Chebyshev 
      acceleration process in our domain decomposition method.},

   ABSTRACT     = {The use of scientific computing centers becomes more and 
      more difficult on modern parallel architectures. Users must face a 
      large variety of batch systems (with their own specific syntax) and 
      have to set many parameters to tune their applications (e.g., 
      processors and/or threads mapping, memory resource constraints). 
      Moreover, finding the optimal performance is not the only criteria 
      when a pool of jobs is submitted on the Grid (for numerical 
      parametric analysis for instance) and one must focus on the wall-time 
      completion. In this work we tackle the problem by using the D IET 
      Grid middleware that integrates an adaptable PaStiX service to solve 
      a set of experiments issued from the simulations of the ASTER 
      project.},

   ABSTRACT     = {Over the past few years, parallel sparse direct solvers 
      made significant progress and are now able to solve efficiently 
      industrial three-dimensional problems with several millions of 
      unknowns. An hybrid MPI-thread implementation of our direct solver 
      PaStiX is already well suited for SMP nodes or new multi-core 
      architectures and drastically reduced the memory overhead and 
      improved scalability. In the context of distributed NUMA 
      architectures, a dynamic scheduler based on a work-stealing algorithm 
      has been developed to fill in communication idle times. On these 
      architectures, it is important to take care of NUMA effects and to 
      preserve memory affinity during the work-stealing. The scheduling of 
      communications also needs to be adapted, especially to ensure the 
      overlap by computations. Experiments on numerical test cases will be 
      presented to prove the efficiency of the approach on NUMA 
      architectures. If memory is not large enough to treat a given 
      problem, disks must be used to store data that cannot fit in memory 
      (out-of-core storage). The idle-times due to disk access have to be 
      managed by our dynamic scheduler to prefetch and save datasets. Thus, 
      we design and study specific scheduling algorithms in this particular 
      context.},

   ABSTRACT     = { Since the last decade, most of the supercomputer 
      architectures are based on cluster of SMP nodes. In those 
      architectures the exchanges between processors are made through 
      shared memory when the processor are located on a same SMP node and 
      through the network otherwise. Generally, the MPI implementations 
      provided by the constructor on those machines are adapted to this 
      situation and take advantage of the share memory to treat messages 
      between processors in a same SMP node. Nevertheless, this transparent 
      approach to exploit shared memory do not avoid the storage of buffers 
      needed in asynchronous communications. In the parallel direct solvers 
      the storage of these buffers can become a bottleneck. In this paper, 
      we propose an hybrid thread-MPI implementation of a direct solver and 
      analyse the benefits of this approach in term of memory and run-time 
      performances. },

   ABSTRACT     = { In this paper, we consider a hyperbolic system with 
      multiple time step characteristics. Such a situation arises for 
      example in combustion problems when the acoustic time is small 
      compared to the characteristic time associated to the flame 
      propagation. The problems investigated in this paper are 
      characterized by a small Mach number. At the asymptotic limit, the 
      initial hyperbolic system degenerates to an elliptic problem. 
      Therefore, numerical methods proposed with the assumption of 
      hyperbolicity of the system becomes hill conditioned at this limit. 
      As a consequence, the iterative methods used in the numerical 
      algorithm implemented in the software FluidBox, have a worse 
      convergence behavior. Some physical preconditioning has been proposed 
      to overcome this difficulty. However, in the context of parallel 
      computing, a global preconditioning is unavoidable for performance 
      efficiency. The parallelization of FluidBox relies on a domain 
      decomposition. A first version of FluidBox was using a block Jacobi 
      or a block Gauss-Seidel preconditioner that are easily implementable 
      in this framework. But to solve 3D problems up to several millions of 
      unknowns on numerous processors, this kind of preconditioner becomes 
      inefficient du to their lack of scalability and robustness. Hence, a 
      collaboration inside the INRIA ScAlApplix project has been setup to 
      use the high performance solver library PaStiX that provides both 
      complete and incomplete factorizations on clusters of SMP nodes to 
      solve large scale computations. The aim of this work is then to 
      investigate the performance of the combination of FluidBox and PaStiX 
      (both developped in the INRIA ScAlApplix project) and also present 
      the parallel assembly algorithm that allows a good load balance in 
      this context. },

   ABSTRACT     = { Solving large sparse linear systems by iterative 
      methods has often been quite unsatisfactory when dealing with 
      pratical "industrial" problems. The main difficulty encountered by 
      such methods is their lack of robustness and, generally, the 
      unpredictability and unconsistency of their performance over a wide 
      sample of different problems; certain methods work quite well for 
      certain types of problems but can fail completely on other problems. 
      Over the past few years, direct methods have made significant 
      progress thanks to either the combinatorial analysis of the Gaussian 
      elimination process and the parallel algorithmic of blockwise solvers 
      optimized for modern parallel supercomputers. Its is now possible to 
      solve practical three-dimensional problems in the order of several 
      millions of equations in a very powerful way with the direct solvers 
      that efficiently use the superscalar effects of modern processors. 
      However, direct methods may fail to solve very large 
      three-dimensional problems, due to the large amount of memory needed 
      for these cases. In our work, we consider an approach which, we hope, 
      will bridge the gap between the two classes of methods. The goal is 
      to provide a method which exploits the parallel blockwise algorithmic 
      used in the framework of the high performance sparse direct solvers 
      for developping robust parallel incomplete factorization based 
      preconditioners for iterative solvers. The idea is then to define an 
      adaptive blockwise incomplete factorization that is much more 
      accurate (and numerically more robust) than the scalar incomplete 
      factorizations commonly used to precondition iterative solvers. Our 
      approach consists in computing symbolically the block structure of 
      the factors that would have been obtained with a complete 
      factorization, and then deciding to drop off some blocks of this 
      structure according to relevant criterions. Such incomplete 
      factorization can take advantage of the latest breakthroughts in 
      sparse direct methods and therefore be very competitive in CPU time 
      while avoiding the memory limitation encountered by direct methods. 
      By this way, we expect to be able to solve systems in the order of 
      hundred millions of unknowns. },

   ABSTRACT     = { L'\'emergence des machines parall\`eles t\'eraflopiques 
      permet maintenant de traiter des probl\`emes de diffraction de tr\`es 
      grande taille li\'es \`a des calculs hautes fr\'equences par des 
      m\'ethodes exactes. Une premi\`ere \'etape de ce travail a 
      constist\'e \`a parall\'eliser des codes s\'equentiels existants qui 
      utilisaient des m\'ethodes num\'eriques classiques. Ces codes 
      \'etaient bas\'es sur un couplage fort par compl\'ement de Schur 
      entre une formulation int\'egrale (\'el\'ements-finis surfaciques 
      pour traiter la condition de radiation \`a l'infini) et une 
      formulation \'el\'ements-finis volumiques (pour calculer les champs 
      \`a l'int\'erieur de l'objet). L'adapation au parall\'elisme a 
      consist\'e \`a parall\'eliser la factorisation du syst\`eme 
      lin\'eaire creux (\`a l'aide de la biblioth\'eque EMILIO/PaStiX, la 
      r\'esolution du syst\`eme int\'egral plein (sym\'etrique, complexe) 
      et le couplage par compl\'ement de Schur (consistant en des 
      descentes-remont\'ees sur le syst\`eme creux associ\'e). Les deux 
      premi\`eres \'etapes cit\'ees ont donn\'e pleinement satisfaction, 
      mais le compl\'ement de Schur, \`a cause du tr\'es grand nombre 
      descentes-remont\'ees li\'ees aux inconnues surfaciques, limite 
      l'efficacit\'e globale de cette approche \`a des probl\`emes de 
      taille interm\'ediaire. Par exemple, pour le cas test du 
      ``Sphere-Cone'' comportant $3.10^6$ d'inconnues volumiques et 
      $23.10^3$ inconnues surfaciques, sur 32 n\oe uds ES45 
      (quadri-processeurs), l'assemblage volumique repr\'esente 6s, la 
      factorisation du syst\`eme creux est obtenue en 376s et le 
      compl\'ement de Schur en 21500s (en complexe double pr\'ecision). 
      Pour d\'epasser ces limites, une \'evolution globale de l'algorithme 
      a \'et\'e n\'ecessaire~: - un couplage it\'eratif entre les 
      r\'esolutions surfacique et volumique a \'et\'e mis en place; - pour 
      augmenter le nombre d'inconnues surfaciques une m\'ethode multip\^ole 
      multi-niveaux parall\'ele a \'et\'e d\'evelopp\'ee; - enfin, pour 
      atteindre des tailles de probl\`eme de plusieurs dizaines de millions 
      d'inconnues volumiques, des \'evolutions ont \'et\'e apport\'ees dans 
      la biblioth\`eque EMILIO/PaStiX. En particulier, une algorithmique 
      sp\'ecifique a \'et\'e mise en place pour utiliser au mieux les 
      clusters de n\oe uds SMP et pour pr\'eserver une scalabilit\'e 
      m\'emoire raisonnable. Enfin, le sch\'ema actuel pr\'esente un 
      couplage direct-it\'eratif \`a plusieurs niveaux. L'\'evolution 
      envisag\'ee sera un couplage it\'eratif-it\'eratif, puis sera bas\'ee 
      sur des m\'ethodes hybrides globales (interm\'ediaire entre le direct 
      et l'it\'eratif)~: une version de PaStiX \'evolu\'ee permettra de 
      calculer un pr\'econdition\-neur par bloc ILU(k) parall\`ele. },

   ABSTRACT     = {In previous works, we have described an efficient static 
      scheduling based on a mixed 1D/2D block distribution with local 
      aggregation for a parallel supernodal version of sparse $LL^{T}$ 
      factorization. In this paper, we present new algorithms suitable for 
      overcoming architectures based on clusters of SMP nodes and also 
      technics to keep a good memory scalability. This algorithms are 
      implemented in the PaStiX library that achieved high performances 
      (resolution of a $26.10^6$ unknown system on 192 ES45 
      quadriprocessors with 35 percent of peak performance). },

      computes efficient static schedulings of block computations for 
      parallel sparse linear factorization. Our solver, based on a 
      supernodal fan-in approach, is fully driven by this scheduling. We 
      give an overview of the algorithms and present performance results on 
      a 16-node IBM-SP2 with 66 MHz Power2 thin nodes for a collection of 
      grid and irregular problems.},

   ABSTRACT     = {{O}ver the past few years, parallel sparse direct 
      solvers made significant progress and are now able to solve 
      efficiently industrial three-dimensional problems with several 
      millions of unknowns. {T}o solve efficiently these problems, 
      {P}a{S}ti{X} and {WSMP} solvers for example, provide an hybrid 
      {MPI}-thread implementation well suited for {SMP} nodes or multi-core 
      architectures. {I}t enables to drastically reduce the memory overhead 
      of the factorization and improve the scalability of the algorithms. 
      {H}owever, today's modern architectures introduce new hierarchical 
      memory accesses that are not handle in these solvers. {W}e present in 
      this paper three improvements on {P}a{S}ti{X} solver to improve the 
      performance on modern architectures : memory allocation, 
      communication overlap and dynamic scheduling and some results on 
      numerical test cases will be presented to prove the efficiency of the 
      approach on {NUMA} architectures.},

   YEAR         = {2018},
   ABSTRACT     = { Sparse direct solvers is a time consuming operation 
      required by many scientific applications to simulate physical 
      problems. By its important overall cost, many studies tried to 
      optimize the time to solution of those solvers on multi-core and 
      distributed architectures. In this talk, we will present recent 
      advances on PaStiX (https://gitlab.inria.fr/solverstack/pastix), a 
      supernodal sparse direct solver, which has been enhanced by the 
      introduction of Block Low-Rank compression. We will compare the 
      numerical stability, and the performance in terms of memory 
      consumption and time to solution of different approaches by selecting 
      when the compression of the factorized matrix occurs. Many works have 
      also addressed heterogeneous architectures to exploit accelerators 
      such as GPUs or Intel Xeon Phi with interesting speedup. The new 
      implementation on top of runtime systems (PaRSEC, StarPU), will be 
      compared with the static scheduling used in previous experiments. 
      Among the preprocessing steps of a sparse direct solver, reordering 
      and block symbolic factorization are two major steps to reach a 
      suitable granularity. In this talk, we will present a reordering 
      strategy to increase off-diagonal block sizes. It enhances BLAS 
      kernels and allows to handle larger tasks, reducing runtime overhead. 
      Finally, in order to improve the efficiency of the sparse update 
      kernel for both BLR (block low rank) and HODLR (hierarchically 
      off-diagonal low-rank), we are currently investigating the BDLR 
      (boundary distance low-rank) method to preselect rows and columns in 
      the low-rank approximation algorithm. },

   ABSTRACT     = { In the context of solving sparse linear systems, an 
      ordering process partitions the matrix graph to minimize both fill-in 
      and computational cost. We found that the ordering strategy used 
      within supernodes might be enhanced to reduce the number of 
      off-diagonal blocks, and then increases block sizes and kernel 
      performance. This turns to be into the same complexity as the 
      factorization algorithm, but allows for more efficient BLAS kernels. 
      On the other side, supernodes that are too large need to be split to 
      create more parallelism. The regular splitting strategy when applied 
      locally impacts significantly the number of off-diagonal blocks and 
      might have negative effect on the efficiency. In this talk, we 
      present both a new strategy to improve supernodes ordering and 
      splitting strategy that both enlarge the off-diagonal block sizes 
      without changing the computational cost of the factorization. 
      Performance improvement gains on the supernodal solver PaStiX are 
      shown on multi-cores and heterogeneous architectures. },

   ABSTRACT     = { In this talk we will discuss the current and future 
      research activities on the design of parallel scalable linear systems 
      for large scale problems that range from dense linear algebra, to 
      parallel sparse direct solver and hybrid iterative-direct approaches 
      that attempt to go beyond the best capabilities one can expect from 
      sparse direct solvers. In particular we will describe the current 
      activities on the implementations designed on top of runtime systems 
      that should provide both code and performance portabilities across 
      different parallel platforms. Finally, we will present some 
      preliminary results to address the resilience issues on extreme scale 
      computers; for that purpose we consider numerical alternatives that 
      do not intensively rely on checkpoint restart mechanisms. },

   ABSTRACT     = { The emergence of many-cores architectures introduces 
      variations in computation costs, which makes precise cost models hard 
      to realize. Static schedulers based on cost models, like the one used 
      in the sparse direct solver PaStiX, are no longer adapted. We 
      describe the dynamic scheduler developed for the super-nodal method 
      of PaStiX to correct the imperfections of the static model. The 
      solution presented exploit the elimination tree of the problem to 
      keep the data locality during the execution.},

   TITLE        = {Sparse direct solvers with accelerators over DAG 
      runtimes},
   YEAR         = {2012},
   ABSTRACT     = { The current trend in the high performance computing 
      shows a dramatic increase in the number of cores on the shared memory 
      compute nodes. Algorithms, especially those related to linear 
      algebra, need to be adapted to these new computer architectures in 
      order to be efficient. PaStiX is a sparse parallel direct solver, 
      that incorporates a dynamic scheduler for strongly hierarchical 
      modern architectures. In this work, we study the replacement of this 
      internal highly integrated scheduling strategy by two generic runtime 
      frameworks: DAGuE and StarPU. Those runtimes will give the 
      opportunity to execute the factorization tasks graph on emerging 
      computers equipped with accelerators. As for previous work done in 
      dense linear algebra, we will present the kernels used for GPU 
      computations inspired by the MAGMA library and the DAG algorithm used 
      with those two runtimes. A comparative study of the performances of 
      the supernodal solver with the three different schedulers is 
      performed on manycore architectures and the improvements obtained 
      with accelerators will be presented with the StarPU runtime. These 
      results demonstrate that these DAG runtimes provide uniform 
      programming interfaces to obtain high performance on different 
      architectures on irregular problems as sparse direct factorizations.},
