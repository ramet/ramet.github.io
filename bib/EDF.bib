  ABSTRACT = {The simulation of the neutron transport inside a nuclear reactor leads to the computation of the lowest eigen pair of a simplified transport operator. Whereas the sequential solution at our disposal today is really efficient, we are not able to run some industrial cases due to the memory consumption and the computational time. This problem brings us to study  parallel strategies. 
In order to re-use an important part of the solver and to bypass some limitations of conforming cartesian meshes, we propose a non overlapping domain decomposition based on the introduction of Lagrange multipliers. The method performs well on up to $100$ processors for an industrial test case.},

  ABSTRACT = {The simulation of the neutron transport inside a nuclear reactor leads to the computation of the lowest eigen pair of a simplified transport operator. This computation is done by a power inverse algorithm accelerated by a Chebyshev polynomials based process. At each iteration, a large linear system is solved inexactly by a block Gauss-Seidel algorithm. For our applications, one Gauss-Seidel iteration is already sufficient to ensure the right convergence of the inverse power algorithm. For the approximate resolution of the linear system at each inverse power iteration, we propose a non overlapping domain decomposition based on the introduction of Lagrange multipliers in order to:
- get a parallel algorithm, which allows to circumvent memory consumption problem and to reduce the computational time;
- deal with different numerical approximations in each subdomain;
- minimize the code modifications in our industrial solver.
When the Chebyshev acceleration process is switched off, the method performs well on up to 100 processors for an industrial test case. It exhibits a good efficiency which allows us to realize some computations beyond the reach of standard workstations. Besides, we study the efficiency of the Chebyshev acceleration process in our domain decomposition method.}

   ABSTRACT =
{The reactivity computations are an essential component for the simulation
of the core of a nuclear plant. These computations lead to generalized
eigenvalue problems solved by the inverse power iteration algorithm.
At each iteration, an algebraic linear system is solved through an
inner/outer process.
With the solver Cocagne developed at EDF, it is difficult to take
into account very fine discretisation, due to the memory
requirement and the computation time. In this thesis, a domain
decomposition method based on the Schur dual technique is
studied. Several placements in the inner/outer process are
possible. Two of them are implemented and the results analyzed.
The second one, which uses the specificities of the Raviart Thomas
finite elements and of the alternating directions algorithm, leads to
very promising results.
From these results the industrialization of the method can be considered.}
