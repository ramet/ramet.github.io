<strong>On finding approximate supernodes for an efficient ILU(k) factorization</strong>.

Abstract: <td>
Among existing preconditioners, the level-of-fill ILU has been quite popular as a general-purpose technique. Experimental observations have shown that, when coupled with block techniques, these methods can be quite effective in solving realistic problems arising from various applications. In this work, we consider an extension of this kind of method which is suitable for parallel environments. Our method is developed from the framework of high performance sparse direct solvers. The main idea we propose is to define an adaptive blockwise incomplete factorization that is much more accurate (and numerically more robust) than the scalar incomplete factorizations commonly used to precondition iterative solvers. These requirements lead to a robust class of parallel preconditioners based on generalized versions of block ILU techniques.</td>

Abstract: <td>
The simulation of the neutron transport inside a nuclear reactor leads to the computation of the lowest eigen pair of a simplified transport operator. This computation is done by a power inverse algorithm accelerated by a Chebyshev polynomials based process. At each iteration, a large linear system is solved inexactly by a block Gauss-Seidel algorithm. For our applications, one Gauss-Seidel iteration is already sufficient to ensure the right convergence of the inverse power algorithm. For the approximate resolution of the linear system at each inverse power iteration, we propose a non overlapping domain decomposition based on the introduction of Lagrange multipliers in order to: - get a parallel algorithm, which allows to circumvent memory consumption problem and to reduce the computational time; - deal with different numerical approximations in each subdomain; - minimize the code modifications in our industrial solver. When the Chebyshev acceleration process is switched off, the method performs well on up to 100 processors for an industrial test case. It exhibits a good efficiency which allows us to realize some computations beyond the reach of standard workstations. Besides, we study the efficiency of the Chebyshev acceleration process in our domain decomposition method.</td>

Abstract: <td>
The simulation of the neutron transport inside a nuclear reactor leads to the computation of the lowest eigen pair of a simplified transport operator. Whereas the sequential solution at our disposal today is really efficient, we are not able to run some industrial cases due to the memory consumption and the computational time. This problem brings us to study parallel strategies. In order to re-use an important part of the solver and to bypass some limitations of conforming cartesian meshes, we propose a non overlapping domain decomposition based on the introduction of Lagrange multipliers. The method performs well on up to $100$ processors for an industrial test case.</td>

Abstract: <td>
The use of scientific computing centers becomes more and more difficult on modern parallel architectures. Users must face a large variety of batch systems (with their own specific syntax) and have to set many parameters to tune their applications (e.g., processors and/or threads mapping, memory resource constraints). Moreover, finding the optimal performance is not the only criteria when a pool of jobs is submitted on the Grid (for numerical parametric analysis for instance) and one must focus on the wall-time completion. In this work we tackle the problem by using the D IET Grid middleware that integrates an adaptable PaStiX service to solve a set of experiments issued from the simulations of the ASTER project.</td>

<strong>A NUMA Aware Scheduler for a Parallel Sparse Direct Solver</strong>.

Abstract: <td>
Over the past few years, parallel sparse direct solvers made significant progress and are now able to solve efficiently industrial three-dimensional problems with several millions of unknowns. An hybrid MPI-thread implementation of our direct solver PaStiX is already well suited for SMP nodes or new multi-core architectures and drastically reduced the memory overhead and improved scalability. In the context of distributed NUMA architectures, a dynamic scheduler based on a work-stealing algorithm has been developed to fill in communication idle times. On these architectures, it is important to take care of NUMA effects and to preserve memory affinity during the work-stealing. The scheduling of communications also needs to be adapted, especially to ensure the overlap by computations. Experiments on numerical test cases will be presented to prove the efficiency of the approach on NUMA architectures. If memory is not large enough to treat a given problem, disks must be used to store data that cannot fit in memory (out-of-core storage). The idle-times due to disk access have to be managed by our dynamic scheduler to prefetch and save datasets. Thus, we design and study specific scheduling algorithms in this particular context.</td>
