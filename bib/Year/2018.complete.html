Abstract: <td>
 Solving sparse linear systems is a problem that arises in many scientific applications, and sparse direct solvers are a time consuming and key kernel for those applications and for more advanced solvers such as hybrid direct-iterative solvers. For those reasons, optimizing their performance on modern architectures is critical. However, memory requirements and time-to-solution limit the use of direct methods for very large matrices. For other approaches, such as iterative methods, general black-box preconditioners that can ensure fast convergence for a wide range of problems are still missing. In the first part of this thesis, we present two approaches using a Block Low-Rank (BLR) compression technique to reduce the memory footprint and/or the time-to-solution of a supernodal sparse direct solver. This flat, non-hierarchical, compression method allows to take advantage of the low-rank property of the blocks appearing during the factorization of sparse linear systems. The proposed solver can be used either as a direct solver at a lower precision or as a very robust preconditioner. The first approach, called Minimal-Memory, illustrates the maximum memory gain that can be obtained with the BLR compression method, while the second approach, called Just-In-Time, mainly focuses on reducing the computational complexity and thus the time-to-solution. In the second part, we present a reordering strategy that increases the block granularity to better take advantage of the locality for multicores and provide larger tasks to GPUs. This strategy relies on the block-symbolic factorization to refine the ordering produced by tools such as Metis or Scotch, but it does not impact the number of operations required to solve the problem. From this approach, we propose in the third part of this manuscript a new low-rank clustering technique that is designed to cluster unknowns within a separator to obtain the BLR partition, and demonstrate its assets with respect to widely used clustering strategies. Both reordering and clustering where designed for the flat BLR representation but are also a first step to move to hierarchical formats. We investigate in the last part of this thesis a modified nested dissection strategy that aligns separators with respect to their father to obtain more regular data structure. </td>

Abstract: <td>
 In this talk, we present new ordering heuristics to perform block low-rank clustering in supernodes issued from the nested dissection. As kway partitioning within supernodes does not take into account interactions between supernodes, there is room to improve compression rates. We combine kway partitioning with a reordering strategy that aims at minimizing the number of off-diagonal blocks in the symbolic structure and show that both methods are limited. In addition, we propose a selection of some non-compressible vertices to handle the corresponding blocks in full-rank and reduce the burden on managing low-rank blocks with high ranks. </td>

Abstract: <td>
 Sparse direct solvers is a time consuming operation required by many scientific applications to simulate physical problems. By its important overall cost, many studies tried to optimize the time to solution of those solvers on multi-core and distributed architectures. In this talk, we will present recent advances on PaStiX (https://gitlab.inria.fr/solverstack/pastix), a supernodal sparse direct solver, which has been enhanced by the introduction of Block Low-Rank compression. We will compare the numerical stability, and the performance in terms of memory consumption and time to solution of different approaches by selecting when the compression of the factorized matrix occurs. Many works have also addressed heterogeneous architectures to exploit accelerators such as GPUs or Intel Xeon Phi with interesting speedup. The new implementation on top of runtime systems (PaRSEC, StarPU), will be compared with the static scheduling used in previous experiments. Among the preprocessing steps of a sparse direct solver, reordering and block symbolic factorization are two major steps to reach a suitable granularity. In this talk, we will present a reordering strategy to increase off-diagonal block sizes. It enhances BLAS kernels and allows to handle larger tasks, reducing runtime overhead. Finally, in order to improve the efficiency of the sparse update kernel for both BLR (block low rank) and HODLR (hierarchically off-diagonal low-rank), we are currently investigating the BDLR (boundary distance low-rank) method to preselect rows and columns in the low-rank approximation algorithm. </td>
