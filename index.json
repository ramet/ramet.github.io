Unfortunately, the increase of the computational units in these systems does not lead to a rise in the memory available per core. Therefore, this memory limitation forces the scientists/engineers to not only efficiently parallelize the operations but also minimize the memory used. Many scientific and engineering applications have to solve large sparse linear systems of the type Ax = b. Although the direct methods are the most robust solutions for these systems, they are costly in terms of their memory usage and time-to-solution. In this respect, the low-rank representations have been recently introduced into these solvers to reduce the time and memory footprint. In this work, our goal is to improve the low-rank feature of the block low-rank (BLR) sparse supernodal direct solver PaStiX. For this purpose, we compare some compression methods to determine the fastest kernel, which keeps the representative data with the smallest rank possible. Then, we focus on improving supernodal solver by reducing the number of re-compression during the updates. Firstly, we study the separator reordering strategies to identify the poorly compressible blocks involved in these updates and reduce their occurrences. Secondly, we propose an orthogonal solution to predict thecompressibility of the blocks before the numerical factorization. This last approach relies on the use of the level of fill of a symbolic block incomplete factorization. Thanks to these optimizations, the memory usage has been reduced more effectively compared to the state of the art solvers while also improving the time to solution. This thesis is a requested first step toward a advanced sparse direct solver using hierarchical compression schemes.

We show that methods considering only intra-separators connectivity (i.e., k-way or recursive bissection) as well as methods managing only interaction between separators have some limitations. The new strategy we propose consider interactions between a separator and its children to pre-select some interactions while reducing the number of off-diagonal blocks.

For those reasons, optimizing their performance on modern architectures is critical. However, memory requirements and time-to-solution limit the use of direct methods for very large matrices. For other approaches, such as iterative methods, general black-box preconditioners that can ensure fast convergence for a wide range of problems are still missing. In the first part of this thesis, we present two approaches using a Block Low-Rank (BLR) compression technique to reduce the memory footprint and/or the time-to-solution of a supernodal sparse direct solver. This flat, non-hierarchical, compression method allows to take advantage of the low-rank property of the blocks appearing during the factorization of sparse linear systems. The proposed solver can be used either as a direct solver at a lower precision or as a very robust preconditioner. The first approach, called Minimal-Memory, illustrates the maximum memory gain that can be obtained with the BLR compression method, while the second approach, called Just-In-Time, mainly focuses on reducing the computational complexity and thus the time-to-solution. In the second part, we present a reordering strategy that increases the block granularity to better take advantage of the locality for multicores and provide larger tasks to GPUs. This strategy relies on the block-symbolic factorization to refine the ordering produced by tools such as Metis or Scotch, but it does not impact the number of operations required to solve the problem. From this approach, we propose in the third part of this manuscript a new low-rank clustering technique that is designed to cluster unknowns within a separator to obtain the BLR partition, and demonstrate its assets with respect to widely used clustering strategies. Both reordering and clustering where designed for the flat BLR representation but are also a first step to move to hierarchical formats.  We investigate in the last part of this thesis a modified nested dissection strategy that aligns separators with respect to their father to obtain more regular data structure.

Our main interest is on direct-iterative hybrid solvers such as HIPS, MAPHYS, PDSLIN or SHYLU, which rely on domain decomposition and Schur complement approaches. Althrough these solvers are not as time and space consuming as direct methods, they still suffer from serious overheads. In a first part, we thus present the existing techniques for reducing the memory consumption, and we present a new method which does not impact the numerical robustness of the preconditioner. This technique reduces the memory peak by doing a special scheduling of computation, allocation, and freeing tasks in particular in the Schur coupling blocks of the matrix. In a second part, we focus on the load balancing of the domain decomposition in a parallel context. This problem consists in partitioning the adjacency graph of the matrix in as many domains as desired. We point out that a good load balancing for the most expensive steps of an hybrid solver such as MAPHYS relies on the balancing of both interior nodes and interface nodes of the domains. Through, until now, graph partitioners such as METIS or SCOTCH used to optimize only the first criteria (i.e. the balancing of interior nodes) in the context of sparse matrix ordering. We propose different variations of the existing algorithms to improve the balancing of interface nodes and interior nodes simultaneously. All our changes are implemented in the SCOTCH partitioner. We present our results on large collection of matrices coming from real industrial cases.

The pressure to maintain reasonable levels of performance and portability forces application developers to leave the traditional programming paradigms and explore alternative solutions. PaStiX is a parallel sparse direct solver, based on a dynamic scheduler for modern hierarchical manycore architectures. In this thesis, we study the benefits and the limits of replacing the highly specialized internal scheduler of the PaStiX solver by two generic runtime systems: PaRSEC and StarPU. Thus, we have to describe the factorization algorithm as a tasks graph that we provide to the runtime system. Then it can decide how to process and optimize the graph traversal in order to maximize the algorithm efficiency for the targeted hardware platform. A comparative study of the performance of the PaStiX solver on top of its original internal scheduler, PaRSEC, and StarPU frameworks is performed. The analysis highlights that these generic task-based runtimes achieve comparable results to the application-optimized embedded scheduler on homogeneous platforms. Furthermore, they are able to significantly speed up the solver on heterogeneous environments by taking advantage of the accelerators while hiding the complexity of their efficient manipulation from the programmer. In this thesis, we also study the possibilities to build a distributed sparse linear solver on top of task-based runtime systems to target heterogeneous clusters. To permit an efficient and easy usage of these developments in parallel simulations, we also present an optimized distributed interface aiming at hiding the complexity of the construction of a distributed matrix to the user.

These methods can have many advantages compared to iterative solvers; in particular their accuracy and performance is less sensitive to the distribution of eigenvalues. However, they typically have a larger computational cost in cases where iterative solvers converge in few iterations. We will discuss a recent trend of methods that address this cost and can make these direct solvers competitive.

The pressure to maintain reasonable levels of performance and portability forces application de- velopers to leave the traditional programming paradigms and explore alternative solutions. PASTIX is a parallel sparse direct solver, based on a dynamic scheduler for modern hierarchical manycore architectures. In this paper, we study the benefits and limits of replacing the highly specialized internal scheduler of the PASTIX solver with two generic runtime systems: PARSEC and STARPU. The tasks graph of the factorization step is made available to the two runtimes, providing them the opportunity to process and optimize its traversal in order to maximize the algorithm efficiency for the targeted hardware platform. A comparative study of the performance of the PASTIX solver on top of its native internal scheduler, PARSEC, and STARPU frameworks, on different execution environments, is performed. The analysis highlights that these generic task-based runtimes achieve comparable results to the application-optimized embed- ded scheduler on homogeneous platforms. Furthermore, they are able to significantly speed up the solver on heterogeneous environments by taking advantage of the accelerators while hiding the complexity of their efficient manipulation from the programmer.","tags":["Sparse"],"title":"Taking advantage of hybrid systems for sparse direct solvers via task-based runtimes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

Algorithms, especially those related to linear algebra, need to be adapted to these new computer architectures in order to be efficient. PaStiX is a sparse parallel direct solver, that incorporates a dynamic  scheduler for strongly hierarchical modern architectures.  In this work, we study the replacement of this internal highly integrated scheduling strategy by two generic runtime frameworks: DAGuE and StarPU. Those runtimes will give the opportunity to execute the factorization tasks graph on emerging computers equipped with accelerators. As for previous work done in dense linear algebra, we will present the kernels used for GPU computations inspired by the MAGMA library and the DAG algorithm used with those two runtimes. A comparative study of the performances of the supernodal solver with the three different schedulers is performed on manycore architectures and the improvements obtained with accelerators will be presented with the StarPU runtime.

Algorithms, especially those related to linear algebra, need to be adapted to these new computer architectures in order to be efficient. PaStiX is a sparse parallel direct solver, that incorporates a dynamic  scheduler for strongly hierarchical modern architectures.  In this work, we study the replacement of this internal highly integrated scheduling strategy by two generic runtime frameworks: DAGuE and StarPU. Those runtimes will give the opportunity to execute the factorization tasks graph on emerging computers equipped with accelerators. As for previous work done in dense linear algebra, we will present the kernels used for GPU computations inspired by the MAGMA library and the DAG algorithm used with those two runtimes. A comparative study of the performances of the supernodal solver with the three different schedulers is performed on ma nycore architectures and the improvements obtained with accelerators will be presented with the StarPU runtime. These results demonstrate that these DAG runtimes provide uniform programming interfaces to obtain high performance on different architectures on irregular problems as sparse direct factorizations.","tags":["Sparse"],"title":"Toward a supernodal sparse direct solver over DAG runtimes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

These computations lead to generalized eigenvalue problems solved by the inverse power iteration algorithm. At each iteration, an algebraic linear system is solved through an inner/outer process. With the solver Cocagne developed at EDF, it is difficult to take into account very fine discretisation, due to the memory requirement and the computation time. In this thesis, a domain decomposition method based on the Schur dual technique is studied. Several placements in the inner/outer process are possible. Two of them are implemented and the results analyzed. The second one, which uses the specificities of the Raviart Thomas finite elements and of the alternating directions algorithm, leads to very promising results. From these results the industrialization of the method can be considered.","tags":["Neutron"],"title":"Domain decomposition method for the Simplified Transport Equation in neutronic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

It enables to drastically reduce the memory overhead of the factorization and improve the scalability of the algorithms.

A domain decomposition is built ; the interiors of the subdomains are eliminated by a direct method in order to use an iterative method only on the interface unknowns. The system on the interface (Schur complement) is solved thanks to an iterative method preconditioned by a global incomplete factorization. A special ordering on the Schur complement allows to build a scalable preconditioner. Algorithms minimizing the memory peak that appears during the construction of the preconditioner are presented. The memory is balanced thanks to a multiple domains per processors parallelization scheme.

For our applications, one Gauss-Seidel iteration is already sufficient to ensure the right convergence of the inverse power algorithm.

Nevertheless, this transparent approach to exploit shared memory do not avoid the storage of buffers needed in asynchronous communications.

The main difficulty encountered by such methods is their lack of robustness and, generally, the unpredictability and unconsistency of their performance over a wide sample of different problems; certain methods work quite well for certain types of problems but can fail completely on other problems.  Over the past few years, direct methods have made significant progress thanks to either the combinatorial analysis of the Gaussian elimination process and the parallel algorithmic of blockwise solvers optimized for modern parallel supercomputers. Its is now possible to solve practical three-dimensional problems in the order of several millions of equations in a very powerful way with the direct solvers that efficiently use the superscalar effects of modern processors.  However, direct methods may fail to solve very large three-dimensional problems, due to the large amount of memory needed for these cases.  In our work, we consider an approach which, we hope, will bridge the gap  between the two classes of methods. The goal is to provide a method which exploits the parallel blockwise algorithmic used in the framework of the high performance sparse direct solvers for developping robust parallel incomplete factorization based preconditioners for iterative solvers.  The idea is then to define an adaptive blockwise incomplete factorization that is much more accurate (and numerically more robust) than the scalar incomplete factorizations commonly used to precondition iterative solvers. Our approach consists in computing symbolically the block structure of the factors that would have been obtained with a complete factorization, and then deciding to drop off some blocks of this structure according to relevant criterions. Such incomplete factorization can take advantage of the latest breakthroughts in sparse direct methods and therefore be very competitive in CPU time  while avoiding the memory limitation encountered by direct methods.  By this way, we expect to be able to solve systems in the order of hundred millions of unknowns.","tags":["Sparse"],"title":"A Blockwise Algorithm for Parallel Incomplete Cholesky Factorization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

Such a situation arises for example in combustion problems when the acoustic time is small compared to the characteristic time associated to the flame propagation. The problems investigated in this paper are characterized by a small Mach number. At the asymptotic limit, the initial hyperbolic system degenerates to an elliptic problem. Therefore, numerical methods proposed with the assumption of hyperbolicity of the system becomes hill conditioned at this limit. As a consequence, the iterative methods used in the numerical algorithm implemented in the software FluidBox, have a worse convergence behavior. Some physical preconditioning has been proposed to overcome this difficulty. However, in the context of parallel computing, a global preconditioning is unavoidable for performance efficiency.  The parallelization of FluidBox relies on a domain decomposition. A first version of FluidBox was using a block Jacobi or a block Gauss-Seidel preconditioner that are easily implementable in this framework. But to solve  3D problems up to several millions of unknowns on numerous processors, this kind of preconditioner becomes inefficient du to their lack of scalability and robustness. Hence, a collaboration inside the INRIA ScAlApplix project has been setup to use the high performance solver library PaStiX that provides both complete and incomplete factorizations on clusters of SMP nodes to solve large scale computations.

In the first part, we describe a method for overlapping communications on parallel computers with distributed memory. This method has resulted in  a generic computation scheme for the optimal packet size. We also tackle the problem of finding the optimal computation grain for the Cholesky factorization algorithm for dense matrices. The goal of this study is to exploit the irregularity induced by the matrix symmetry. Based on this work we have developped a portable software library providing an efficient application context for these techniques.  The second part of this thesis presents and analyses a general algorithm for the computation of an efficient static scheduling of block computations, developped especially for a parallel direct sparse linear factorization based on a combination of 1D and 2D block distributions. Our solver uses a supernodal Fan-In approach and is fully driven by our static scheduling algorithm. Compared to the existing parallel direct solvers our solver shows very favorable performance results.","tags":["Overlap","Sparse"],"title":"Optimisation de la Communication et de la Distribution des Données pour des Solveurs Parallèles Directs en Algb̀re Lináire Dense et Creuse","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.
