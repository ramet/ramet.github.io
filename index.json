We show that methods considering only intra-separators connectivity (i.e., k-way or recursive bissection) as well as methods managing only interaction between separators have some limitations. The new strategy we propose consider interactions between a separator and its children to pre-select some interactions while reducing the number of off-diagonal blocks. We demonstrate how this method enhance the BLR strategies in the sparse direct supernodal solver PaStiX, and discuss how it can be extended to low-rank formats with more than one level of hierarchy.

In this talk, we will present the use of two different programming models: Sequential Task Flow from StarPU, and Parameterized Task Graph from PaRSEC to parallelize the factorization step of the PaStiX sparse direct solver. We will present how those programming models have been used to integrate more complex and finer parallelism to take into account new architectures with many computational units. Efficiency of such solutions on homogeneous and heterogeneous architectures with a spectrum of matrices from different applications will be shown. We will also present how such solutions enable, without extra cost to the programmer, better performance on irregular computations such as in the block low-rank implementation of the solver.

For those reasons, optimizing their performance on modern architectures is critical. However, memory requirements and time-to-solution limit the use of direct methods for very large matrices. For other approaches, such as iterative methods, general black-box preconditioners that can ensure fast convergence for a wide range of problems are still missing. In the first part of this thesis, we present two approaches using a Block Low-Rank (BLR) compression technique to reduce the memory footprint and/or the time-to-solution of a supernodal sparse direct solver. This flat, non-hierarchical, compression method allows to take advantage of the low-rank property of the blocks appearing during the factorization of sparse linear systems. The proposed solver can be used either as a direct solver at a lower precision or as a very robust preconditioner. The first approach, called Minimal-Memory, illustrates the maximum memory gain that can be obtained with the BLR compression method, while the second approach, called Just-In-Time, mainly focuses on reducing the computational complexity and thus the time-to-solution. In the second part, we present a reordering strategy that increases the block granularity to better take advantage of the locality for multicores and provide larger tasks to GPUs. This strategy relies on the block-symbolic factorization to refine the ordering produced by tools such as Metis or Scotch, but it does not impact the number of operations required to solve the problem. From this approach, we propose in the third part of this manuscript a new low-rank clustering technique that is designed to cluster unknowns within a separator to obtain the BLR partition, and demonstrate its assets with respect to widely used clustering strategies. Both reordering and clustering where designed for the flat BLR representation but are also a first step to move to hierarchical formats.  We investigate in the last part of this thesis a modified nested dissection strategy that aligns separators with respect to their father to obtain more regular data structure.

As kway partitioning within supernodes does not take into account interactions between supernodes, there is room to improve compression rates. We combine kway partitioning with a reordering strategy that aims at minimizing the number of off-diagonal blocks in the symbolic structure and show that both methods are limited. In addition, we propose a selection of some non-compressible vertices to handle the corresponding blocks in full-rank and reduce the burden on managing low-rank blocks with high ranks.

By its important overall cost, many studies tried to optimize the time to solution of those solvers on multi-core and distributed architectures.  In this talk, we will present recent advances on PaStiX (https://gitlab.inria.fr/solverstack/pastix), a supernodal sparse direct solver, which has been enhanced by the introduction of Block Low-Rank compression.  We will compare the numerical stability, and the performance in terms of memory consumption and time to solution of different approaches by selecting when the compression of the factorized matrix occurs. Many works have also addressed heterogeneous architectures to exploit accelerators such as GPUs or Intel Xeon Phi with interesting speedup. The new implementation on top of runtime systems (PaRSEC, StarPU), will be compared with the static scheduling used in previous experiments. Among the preprocessing steps of a sparse direct solver, reordering and block symbolic factorization are two major steps to reach a suitable granularity. In this talk, we will present a reordering strategy to increase off-diagonal block sizes. It enhances BLAS kernels and allows to handle larger tasks, reducing runtime overhead. Finally, in order to improve the efficiency of the sparse update kernel for both BLR (block low rank) and HODLR (hierarchically off-diagonal low-rank), we are currently investigating the BDLR (boundary distance low-rank) method to preselect rows and columns in the low-rank approximation algorithm.

Our main interest is on direct-iterative hybrid solvers such as HIPS, MAPHYS, PDSLIN or SHYLU, which rely on domain decomposition and Schur complement approaches. Althrough these solvers are not as time and space consuming as direct methods, they still suffer from serious overheads. In a first part, we thus present the existing techniques for reducing the memory consumption, and we present a new method which does not impact the numerical robustness of the preconditioner. This technique reduces the memory peak by doing a special scheduling of computation, allocation, and freeing tasks in particular in the Schur coupling blocks of the matrix. In a second part, we focus on the load balancing of the domain decomposition in a parallel context. This problem consists in partitioning the adjacency graph of the matrix in as many domains as desired. We point out that a good load balancing for the most expensive steps of an hybrid solver such as MAPHYS relies on the balancing of both interior nodes and interface nodes of the domains. Through, until now, graph partitioners such as METIS or SCOTCH used to optimize only the first criteria (i.e. the balancing of interior nodes) in the context of sparse matrix ordering. We propose different variations of the existing algorithms to improve the balancing of interface nodes and interior nodes simultaneously. All our changes are implemented in the SCOTCH partitioner. We present our results on large collection of matrices coming from real industrial cases.

It allows BLAS kernels to be more efficient, and those ideas could be explored in the context of a low-rank strategy.","tags":["sparse"],"title":"On the use of H-Matrix Arithmetic in PaStiX: a Preliminary Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

The pressure to maintain reasonable levels of performance and portability forces application developers to leave the traditional programming paradigms and explore alternative solutions. PaStiX is a parallel sparse direct solver, based on a dynamic scheduler for modern hierarchical manycore architectures. In this thesis, we study the benefits and the limits of replacing the highly specialized internal scheduler of the PaStiX solver by two generic runtime systems: PaRSEC and StarPU. Thus, we have to describe the factorization algorithm as a tasks graph that we provide to the runtime system. Then it can decide how to process and optimize the graph traversal in order to maximize the algorithm efficiency for the targeted hardware platform. A comparative study of the performance of the PaStiX solver on top of its original internal scheduler, PaRSEC, and StarPU frameworks is performed. The analysis highlights that these generic task-based runtimes achieve comparable results to the application-optimized embedded scheduler on homogeneous platforms. Furthermore, they are able to significantly speed up the solver on heterogeneous environments by taking advantage of the accelerators while hiding the complexity of their efficient manipulation from the programmer. In this thesis, we also study the possibilities to build a distributed sparse linear solver on top of task-based runtime systems to target heterogeneous clusters. To permit an efficient and easy usage of these developments in parallel simulations, we also present an optimized distributed interface aiming at hiding the complexity of the construction of a distributed matrix to the user.

For this purpose, we revisit the original algorithm introduced by Lipton, Rose and Tarjan which performed the recursion for nested dissection in a particular manner. From this specific recursive strategy, we propose in this paper several variations of the existing algorithms in the multilevel Scotch partitioner that take into account these multiple criteria and we illustrate the improved results on a collection of graphs corresponding to finite element meshes used in numerical scientific applications.","tags":["sparse"],"title":"An improved recursive graph bipartitioning algorithm for well balanced domain decomposition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

A domain decomposition is built ; the interiors of the subdomains are eliminated by a direct method in order to use an iterative method only on the interface unknowns. The system on the interface (Schur complement) is solved thanks to an iterative method preconditioned by a global incomplete factorization. A special ordering on the Schur complement allows to build a scalable preconditioner. Algorithms minimizing the memory peak that appears during the construction of the preconditioner are presented. The memory is balanced thanks to a multiple domains per processors parallelization scheme.

For our applications, one Gauss-Seidel iteration is already sufficient to ensure the right convergence of the inverse power algorithm.

In those architectures the exchanges between processors are made through shared memory when the processor are located on a same SMP node and through the network otherwise. Generally, the MPI implementations provided by the constructor on those machines are adapted to this situation and take advantage of the share memory to treat messages between processors in a same SMP node. Nevertheless, this transparent approach to exploit shared memory do not avoid the storage of buffers needed in asynchronous communications. In the parallel direct solvers the storage of these buffers can become a bottleneck. In this paper, we propose an hybrid thread-MPI implementation of a direct solver and analyse the benefits of this approach in term of memory and run-time performances.","tags":["sparse"],"title":"On using an hybrid MPI-Thread programming for the implementation of a parallel sparse direct solver on a network of SMP nodes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

The main difficulty encountered by such methods is their lack of robustness and, generally, the unpredictability and unconsistency of their performance over a wide sample of different problems; certain methods work quite well for certain types of problems but can fail completely on other problems.  Over the past few years, direct methods have made significant progress thanks to either the combinatorial analysis of the Gaussian elimination process and the parallel algorithmic of blockwise solvers optimized for modern parallel supercomputers. Its is now possible to solve practical three-dimensional problems in the order of several millions of equations in a very powerful way with the direct solvers that efficiently use the superscalar effects of modern processors.  However, direct methods may fail to solve very large three-dimensional problems, due to the large amount of memory needed for these cases.  In our work, we consider an approach which, we hope, will bridge the gap  between the two classes of methods. The goal is to provide a method which exploits the parallel blockwise algorithmic used in the framework of the high performance sparse direct solvers for developping robust parallel incomplete factorization based preconditioners for iterative solvers.  The idea is then to define an adaptive blockwise incomplete factorization that is much more accurate (and numerically more robust) than the scalar incomplete factorizations commonly used to precondition iterative solvers. Our approach consists in computing symbolically the block structure of the factors that would have been obtained with a complete factorization, and then deciding to drop off some blocks of this structure according to relevant criterions. Such incomplete factorization can take advantage of the latest breakthroughts in sparse direct methods and therefore be very competitive in CPU time  while avoiding the memory limitation encountered by direct methods.  By this way, we expect to be able to solve systems in the order of hundred millions of unknowns.","tags":["sparse"],"title":"A Blockwise Algorithm for Parallel Incomplete Cholesky Factorization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

Such a situation arises for example in combustion problems when the acoustic time is small compared to the characteristic time associated to the flame propagation. The problems investigated in this paper are characterized by a small Mach number. At the asymptotic limit, the initial hyperbolic system degenerates to an elliptic problem. Therefore, numerical methods proposed with the assumption of hyperbolicity of the system becomes hill conditioned at this limit. As a consequence, the iterative methods used in the numerical algorithm implemented in the software FluidBox, have a worse convergence behavior. Some physical preconditioning has been proposed to overcome this difficulty. However, in the context of parallel computing, a global preconditioning is unavoidable for performance efficiency.  The parallelization of FluidBox relies on a domain decomposition. A first version of FluidBox was using a block Jacobi or a block Gauss-Seidel preconditioner that are easily implementable in this framework. But to solve  3D problems up to several millions of unknowns on numerous processors, this kind of preconditioner becomes inefficient du to their lack of scalability and robustness. Hence, a collaboration inside the INRIA ScAlApplix project has been setup to use the high performance solver library PaStiX that provides both complete and incomplete factorizations on clusters of SMP nodes to solve large scale computations.  The aim of this work is then to investigate the performance of the combination of FluidBox and PaStiX (both developped in the INRIA ScAlApplix project) and also present the parallel assembly algorithm that allows a good load balance in this context.","tags":["sparse"],"title":"Using of the High Performance Sparse Solver PaStiX for the Complex Multiscale 3D Simulations performed by the FluidBox Fluid Mechanics Software","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

In the first part, we describe a method for overlapping communications on parallel computers with distributed memory. This method has resulted in  a generic computation scheme for the optimal packet size. We also tackle the problem of finding the optimal computation grain for the Cholesky factorization algorithm for dense matrices. The goal of this study is to exploit the irregularity induced by the matrix symmetry. Based on this work we have developped a portable software library providing an efficient application context for these techniques.  The second part of this thesis presents and analyses a general algorithm for the computation of an efficient static scheduling of block computations, developped especially for a parallel direct sparse linear factorization based on a combination of 1D and 2D block distributions. Our solver uses a supernodal Fan-In approach and is fully driven by our static scheduling algorithm. Compared to the existing parallel direct solvers our solver shows very favorable performance results.","tags":["overlap","sparse"],"title":"Optimisation de la Communication et de la Distribution des Données pour des Solveurs Parallèles Directs en Algb̀re Lináire Dense et Creuse","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

More precisely, we will focus on some specific parallel sparse linear algebra algorithms which are the most time-consuming steps to solve efficiently such an engineering application. First, we present a general algorithm which computes an efficient static scheduling of block computations for parallel sparse linear factorization. The associated solver, based on a supernodal fan-in approach, is fully driven by this scheduling. Second we describe a scalable parallel assembly algorithm based on a distribution of elements induced by the previous distribution for the blocks of the sparse matrix.
