 abstract = {
Solving sparse linear systems is a problem that arises in many
scientific applications, and sparse direct solvers are a time
consuming and key kernel for those applications and for more
advanced solvers such as hybrid direct-iterative solvers. For those
reasons, optimizing their performance on modern architectures is
critical. However, memory requirements and time-to-solution limit
the use of direct methods for very large matrices. For other
approaches, such as iterative methods, general black-box
preconditioners that can ensure fast convergence for a wide range of
problems are still missing. In the first part of this thesis, we
present two approaches using a Block Low-Rank (BLR) compression
technique to reduce the memory footprint and/or the time-to-solution
of a supernodal sparse direct solver. This flat, non-hierarchical,
compression method allows to take advantage of the low-rank property
of the blocks appearing during the factorization of sparse linear
systems. The proposed solver can be used either as a direct solver
at a lower precision or as a very robust preconditioner. The first
approach, called Minimal-Memory, illustrates the maximum memory gain that
can be obtained with the BLR compression method, while the second
approach, called Just-In-Time, mainly focuses on reducing the
computational complexity and thus the time-to-solution. In the
second part, we present a reordering strategy that increases the
block granularity to better take advantage of the locality for
multicores and provide larger tasks to GPUs. This strategy relies on
the block-symbolic factorization to refine the ordering produced by
tools such as Metis or Scotch, but it does not impact the number
of operations required to solve the problem. From this approach, we
propose in the third part of this manuscript a new low-rank
clustering technique that is designed to cluster unknowns within a
separator to obtain the BLR partition, and demonstrate its assets
with respect to widely used clustering strategies. Both reordering
and clustering where designed for the flat BLR representation but
are also a first step to move to hierarchical formats.  We
investigate in the last part of this thesis a modified nested
dissection strategy that aligns separators with respect to their
father to obtain more regular data structure.
