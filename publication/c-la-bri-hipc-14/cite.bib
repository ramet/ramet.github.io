 abstract = {
In the context of hybrid sparse linear solvers based on domain decomposition
and Schur complement approaches, getting a domain decomposition tool leading
to a good balancing of both the internal node set size and the interface node set size
for all the domains is a critical point for load balancing and efficiency issues in a
parallel computation context. For this purpose, we revisit the original algorithm introduced by Lipton, Rose and
Tarjan which performed the recursion for nested dissection in
a particular manner. From this specific recursive strategy, we propose in this paper several variations of
the existing algorithms in the multilevel Scotch partitioner that take into account
these multiple criteria and we illustrate the improved results on a collection of
graphs corresponding to finite element meshes used in numerical scientific applications.},
