 abstract = {New supercomputers incorporate many microprocessors which include themselves one or many computational cores. These new architectures induce strongly hierarchical topologies. These are called NUMA architectures. Sparse direct solvers are a basic building block of many numerical simulation algorithms. They need to be adapted to these new architectures with Non Uniform Memory Accesses. We propose to introduce a dynamic scheduling designed for NUMA architectures in the PaStiX, solver. The data structures of the solver, as well as the patterns of communication have been modified to meet the needs of these architectures and dynamic scheduling. We are also interested in the dynamic adaptation of the computation grain to use efficiently multi-core architectures and shared memory. Experiments on several numerical test cases will be presented to prove the efficiency of the approach on different architectures.},
