 abstract = {The reactivity computations are an essential component for the simulation
of the core of a nuclear plant. These computations lead to generalized
eigenvalue problems solved by the inverse power iteration algorithm.
At each iteration, an algebraic linear system is solved through an
inner/outer process.
With the solver Cocagne developed at EDF, it is difficult to take
into account very fine discretisation, due to the memory
requirement and the computation time. In this thesis, a domain
decomposition method based on the Schur dual technique is
studied. Several placements in the inner/outer process are
possible. Two of them are implemented and the results analyzed.
The second one, which uses the specificities of the Raviart Thomas
finite elements and of the alternating directions algorithm, leads to
very promising results.
From these results the industrialization of the method can be considered.},
