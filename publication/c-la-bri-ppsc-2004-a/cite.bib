 abstract = {
PaStiX is a scientific library that provides a high performance direct supernodal solver for very large sparse linear systems. It relies on a block factorization based on an hybrid ordering (Nested Dissection + Halo Approximate Minimum Degree) obtained using the Scotch library. Efficient static scheduling and memory management are used to solve irregular problems with more of 25 millions unknowns on clusters of SMP nodes.
In order to solve larger 3D problems, we apply these blockwise algorithms to compute robust and efficient parallel ILU preconditioners.},
