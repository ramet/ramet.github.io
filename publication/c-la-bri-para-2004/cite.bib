 abstract = {The purpose of our work is to provide a method which exploits the parallel blockwise algorithmic approach used in the framework of high performance sparse direct solvers in order to develop robust preconditioners based on a parallel incomplete factorization. The idea is then to define an adaptive blockwise incomplete factorization that is much more accurate (and numerically more robust) than the scalar incomplete factorizations commonly used to precondition iterative solvers.},
