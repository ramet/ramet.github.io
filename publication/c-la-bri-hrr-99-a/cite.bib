 abstract = {We present and analyze a general algorithm which computes efficient static schedulings of block computations for parallel sparse linear factorization. Our solver, based on a supernodal fan-in approach, is fully driven by this scheduling. We give an overview of the algorithms and present performance results on a 16-node IBM-SP2 with 66 MHz Power2 thin nodes for a collection of grid and irregular problems.},
