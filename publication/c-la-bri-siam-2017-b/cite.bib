 abstract = {Sparse direct solvers is a time consuming operation required by many
scientific applications to simulate physical problems. By its important overall
cost, many studies tried to optimize the time to solution of those solvers
on multi-core and distributed architectures. More recently, many works
have addressed heterogeneous architectures to exploit accelerators such as
GPUs or Intel Xeon Phi with interesting speedup. Despite researches towards
generic solutions to efficiently exploit those accelerators, their hardware
evolution requires continual adaptation of the kernels running on those
architectures. The recent Nvidia architectures, as Kepler, present a larger
number of parallel units thus requiring more data to feed every computational
units. A solution considered to supply enough computation has been
to study problems with large number of small computations. The batched
BLAS libraries proposed by Intel, Nvidia, or the University of Tennessee are
examples of this solution. We discuss in this talk the use of the variable size
batched matrix-matrix multiply to improve the performance of a the PaStiX
sparse direct solver. Indeed, this kernel suits the supernodal method of the
solver, and the multiple updates of variable sizes that occur during the numerical
factorization. Performance results on a spectrum of matrices with
different properties will be presented.},
