 abstract = {This paper describes a distribution of elements for irregular finite element meshes as well as the associated parallel assembly algorithm, in the context of parallel solving of the resulting sparse linear system using a direct block solver. These algorithms are integrated in the software processing chain EMILIO being developped at LaBRI for structural mechanics applications. Some illustrative numerical experiments on IBM SP2 validate this study.},
