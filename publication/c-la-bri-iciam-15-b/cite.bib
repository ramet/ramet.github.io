 abstract = {In the context of hybrid sparse linear solvers based on domain decomposition and Schur complement approaches, getting a domain decomposition tool leading to a good balancing of both the internal node set size and the interface node set size is a critical point for parallel computation.  We propose several variations of the existing algorithms in the multilevel Scotch partitioner and we illustrate the improved results on a collection of graphs coming from numerical scientific applications.},
