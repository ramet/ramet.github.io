 abstract = {In this talk we will discuss our research activities on the design of parallel linear solvers for large scale problems that range from dense linear algebra, to parallel sparse direct solver and hybrid iterative-direct approaches. In particular we will describe the implementations designed on top of runtime systems that should provide both code and performance portabilities. Finally, we will present some preliminary results on the integration of h-matrice kernels in our sparse direct solver framework.},
