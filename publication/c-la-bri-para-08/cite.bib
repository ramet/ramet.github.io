 abstract = {Over the past few years, parallel sparse direct solvers made significant progress and are now able to efficiently work on problems with several millions of equations. This paper presents some improvements on our sparse direct solver PaStiX1 for distributed Non-Uniform Memory Access architectures. We show results on two preliminary works: a memory allocation scheme more adapted to these architectures and a better overlap of communication by computation. We also present a dynamic scheduler that takes care of memory affinity and data locality.},
